Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication difficulties, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Autism affects individuals across their lifespan and can significantly impact their daily functioning, relationships, and overall quality of life.

The problem addressed in this project is the need for accurate and timely autism prediction, particularly in the early stages of development. Early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is crucial for initiating appropriate interventions and support, but it can be challenging due to the diverse and subtle nature of ASD symptoms. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a reliable and efficient system for autism prediction, with the goal of improving early identification and intervention for individuals with ASD.
